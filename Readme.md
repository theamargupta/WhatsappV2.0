**_Module consumers!_** Frustrated by each module having its own wildly
unique README format? Annoyed by modules that omit critical sections like
**API** or **Examples**? Stuck scrolling through API docs before you _even know
what the module does_?

**_Module authors!_** Tired of making up your readme format every time you
write it? Do you just want consistent readmes pre-populated with your module's
name, description and license without worrying about the structure every time?
